# earthquake-forecast
Forecasting small scale earthquakes in the vicinity of Israel.
The aim of this project is to forecast magnitudes and locations of a small scale (up to 3.5 on a Richter scale) earthquakes in the vicinity of Israel. At this stage based on eathquake data of Geological Survey for a year 2018.
 Location of small magnitude earthquakes along the Dead Sea Fault (North - South) was also forecasted with SK-learn with Linear Regression and XGBoost algorithms.

Location of 2018 earthquakes is visualised on the map (with folium pakage)
